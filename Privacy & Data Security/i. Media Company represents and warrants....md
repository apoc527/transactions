i. Media Company represents and warrants that all Sites on which Advertiser’s Ads will appear in connection with the IO are free of Spyware, Adware or Drive-by Downloads applications, traffic or channels and that all impressions, clicks or other measurements are not fraudulent. Media Company’s click-throughs of any link other than Advertiser’s Ads, or use of any other means of artificially enhancing click results or otherwise manipulating performance (including by recording as delivered impressions that were not actually delivered) shall be a material breach of this Agreement. Advertiser and Agency represent and warrant that all Advertiser’s Ads submitted in connection with the IO are free of Spyware, Adware or Drive-by Downloads applications, traffic or channels. As used in this paragraph, (1) “Spyware” means any software that covertly gathers user information through the user's Internet connection without his or her knowledge, and transmits such information to a third-party, often for advertising purposes. The information that can be collected using Spyware includes, but is not limited to, the user’s activity on the Internet, or personal information such as passwords, email addresses or financial information. Spyware applications are often bundled as a hidden component of freeware or shareware programs that can be downloaded from the Internet, and in any event are downloaded or installed without the user’s knowledge or consent; (2) “Adware” means any downloadable software program that causes advertising to be displayed to a computer user including programs that display pop-up or pop-under advertisements, redirect website or search requests, install toolbars onto Internet browsers or electronic mail clients, highlight particular keywords or phrases for Internet users as they search the Internet, or similar mechanisms, and which application was downloaded or installed without the user’s explicit knowledge and consent; and (3) "Drive-by 
Download" means any software installation process or procedure initiated as the direct or indirect result of a page or Ad view unless the user receiving the download requested it by voluntarily clicking on a button containing words such as "download now" (or words of similar meaning) immediately prior to the initiation of such process or procedure (the user's consent must be given in response to a clear download offer; agreement by the user to proceed past a security warning, alone, is not sufficient). Additionally, Media Company and its ad network partners represent and warrant that all the Sites on which Advertiser’s Ads will appear in connection with this Insertion Order are free of viruses, Trojan horses, trap doors, back doors, Easter eggs, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to, or have the capacity to, damage, interfere with, intercept or expropriate any system data or personal information. Media Company and its Network Sites will proactively monitor and prevent Spyware or Adware agents from calling Advertiser Tags and will otherwise prevent any unauthorized use of Tags.
