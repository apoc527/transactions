“During the term of the Agreement, before X may sell the Object to a third party, X shall first offer the Object to Y on the same terms and conditions as are offered by the third party. Y shall have 30 days during which to accept said offer. If Y does not accept said offer within said period, X shall be free to accept the third-party offer. If X does not enter into an agreement with the third party on said terms and conditions and close the transaction within 90 days, X’s right to sell the Object to the third party shall expire and the procedure described in this Section shall again be applicable.”
