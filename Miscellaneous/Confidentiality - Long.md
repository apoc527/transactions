Obligations Regarding Confidential Information.

(a) The Party receiving any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party shall not disclose such information to third parties for three (3) years following the date that the disclosing Party first discloses such Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement, except that the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information: (i) to its employees, directors, affiliates, advisors, agents, independent contractors and consultants (together, “Representatives”) on a need-to-know basis, provided that the receiving Party has executed appropriate written agreements with each of such Representatives sufficient to enable compliance by the receiving Party with all the provisions of this Agreement and requiring such Representative, for the benefit of the disclosing Party, to maintain the confidence of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement; or (ii) in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order or request, provided the receiving Party shall give the disclosing Party reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order, or obtain written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that will afford the Confidential Information of the other Party the highest level of protection afforded under applicable law or regulation. The receiving Party shall be responsible for any failure by any of its Representatives to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, and the receiving Party agrees, at its sole expense, to restrain its Representatives from the disclosure or use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the extent prohibited or unauthorized by this Agreement.

(b) The receiving Party shall take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party.

(c) The receiving Party agrees not to disclose, reproduce, summarize and/or distribute the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party except in pursuance of the receiving Party's business relationship with the disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder.

(d) The receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or any other breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party or its employees, interns, agents, independent contractors or consultants.

(e) The receiving Party shall, at the disclosing Party’s request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party, or at the disclosing Party's option, certify destruction of the same. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 1(e), neither of the Parties shall be obligated to erase Confidential Information that is contained in an archived computer system backup that was made in accordance with such Party's security and/or disaster recovery procedures; provided, however, that any such Confidential Information contained in such archived computer system backup shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
