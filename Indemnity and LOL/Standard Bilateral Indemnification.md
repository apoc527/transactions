Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold the other party and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees and Providers, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim against an indemnified party that, taking the allegations to be true, would constitute a breach of the representations, warranties or obligations of the indemnifying party under this Agreement. The parties’ indemnification obligations under this section are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of any such claim, promptly tendering the control of the defense and settlement of any such claim to the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense and with the indemnifying party’s choice of counsel), and cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s request and expense) in defending or settling such claim; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not have the authority to enter into any settlement or compromise of any such claim without the indemnified party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. An indemnified party shall at all times have the option to participate in the defense of any claim through counsel of its own selection and at its own expense.
