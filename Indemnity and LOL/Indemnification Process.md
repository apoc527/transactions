## Indemnification Process.

 

1. In the event that either party wishes to make a claim for indemnification under this Section, the party making the claim (the  “Asserting Party”) must notify the other party (the “Defending Party”) of the nature and basis of such claim for indemnification in writing and in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the events giving rise to the claim; provided that the failure of the Asserting Party to promptly give notice shall not relieve the Defending Party of its obligations except to the extent, if any, that the Defending Party shall have been prejudiced thereby.
2. If the Defending Party does not object in writing to such indemnification claim within 30 days of receiving notice thereof (60 days if the Defending Party is outside of the United States), the Asserting Party shall be entitled to recover from the Defending Party the amount of such claim; if the Defending Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the Asserting Party shall nevertheless be entitled to recover from the Defending Party the lesser amount, without prejudice to the Asserting Party’s claim for the difference.
3. If the Defending Party objects in writing to such indemnification claim within 30 days of receiving notice thereof (60 days if the Defending Party is outside of the United States), the validity of the indemnification claim and the extent of the Defending Party’s liability therefor, shall be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
4. If such claim relates to a claim, suit, litigation, or other action by a third party against the Asserting Party or any fixed or contingent liability to a third party (a “Third Party Claim”), the Defending Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its own expense, provided, however, the Asserting Party shall have the right to reasonably participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by the Asserting Party.  Participation in such defense shall not be deemed an admission of liability as against any such third party.  The Defending Party shall have the right to settle any Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of the Asserting Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
